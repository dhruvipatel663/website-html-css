                We live in the information society. Consequently, computers are nowadays ubiquitous in every aspect of our lives. Computer applications
                are used in many central sectors of our society: health, bank, security, etc. Of course, education is not an exception, and it introduces 
                unique technical, managerial and most importantly pedagogical issues. These unique features make computers and education a field of study 
                on its own. Software being one of the largest growing sectors of the Indian economy, the department of computer engineering at MBIT has 
                been at the forefront of churning out software engineers with a high caliber of technical expertise. It continues to foster and engender 
                the innovation and breadth of vision necessary to excel in the blooming software industry. The experienced faculty exposes the would be 
                computer engineers to a rigorous and exhaustive curriculum designed to bring out the best in them and to keep them in touch with the  
                latest state of the art   technology.
